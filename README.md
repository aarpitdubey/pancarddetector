# pancarddetector
This project will help the different organizations in detecting whether the Id i.e. the PAN card provided to them by their employees or customers or anyone is original or not.
It is very basic ML project which detect Tampered/fake PAN Card based on Structural Similarity and difference in the shape of the images.
